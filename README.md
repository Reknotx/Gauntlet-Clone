# Gauntlet-Clone
Clone of the Arcade Game Gauntlet for CAGD 380
Goal of this class project was to create a clone of the arcade game with multiplayer functionality.
Input was created with the use of the new Unity Input System package. Multiplayer is unfortunately
not implemented due to lack of time and documentation to properly implement one.
